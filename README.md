# Miller Slackbot
A bot for slack that simulates Captain Scott Miller (Arma 3 character).
This is an import from an old GitLab repository.

Miller can react to common sentences. He also understands most insults and can be used as a moderator (add him to the channel).
Miller was originaly developed for a french community. He does understand french but only respond in english.
All responses are inspired from the Armaverse or directly taken from the Arma 3 "East Wind" campaign.

## Installation
